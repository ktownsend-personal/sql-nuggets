# sql-nuggets

Sometimes I create some really useful SQL queries.

I have been using SQL Server for a very long time...since version 6.5, before they used years as version numbers. On occasion I create something worth remembering and sharing.

## Nuggets

Each nugget has a folder with a `README.md` file for more information. The nugget itself is in the corresponding `.sql` file in that folder.
