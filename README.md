# sql-nuggets

Sometimes I create some really useful SQL Server queries.

I have been using SQL Server for a very long time...since version 6.5, before they used years as version numbers. On occasion I create something extra special that transcends the usual routine work and it deserves sharing.

Feedback is welcome. If you fix a problem or add a useful feature feel free to submit a PR and give me some details about it.

## Nuggets

Each nugget has a folder with a README file for more information.

The links below are directly to the SQL files, since I can't link to a folder.

|nugget|description|

|[data-compare](data-compare/data-compare.sql)|compare any two sets of data|
|[table-row-counts](table-row-counts/table-row-counts.sql)|row counts for all tables in a database|
