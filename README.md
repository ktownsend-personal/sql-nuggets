# sql-nuggets

Sometimes I create some really useful SQL Server queries.

I have been using SQL Server for a very long time...since version 6.5, before they used years as version numbers. On occasion I create something extra special that transcends the usual routine work and it deserves sharing.

Feedback is welcome. If you fix a problem or add a useful feature feel free to submit a PR and give me some details about it.
